## üß† Overview

This week focuses on IO programming in Java, including handling CSV and JSON data formats, plus advanced Java concepts like annotations, reflection, and design principles.

## üìò Topics Covered

### Day 1: CSV Data Handling  
- Introduction to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format  
- Reading CSV files in Java using BufferedReader and Scanner  
- Writing data to CSV files  
- Parsing and processing CSV data effectively  

### Day 2: JSON Data  
- What is JSON and understanding its structure  
- Using popular Java libraries like Jackson and Gson for JSON parsing  
- Reading JSON data into Java objects  
- Writing Java objects to JSON strings and files  

### Day 3: Annotations, Reflection, and Design Principles  
- Introduction to Java Annotations and their usage scenarios  
- Creating and using custom annotations  
- Using the Reflection API to inspect and manipulate classes at runtime  
- Overview of key design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and KISS
